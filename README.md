# 👁️🔒 Gaze Authentication Against Shoulder Surfing

**Gaze Authentication Against Shoulder Surfing** is an innovative **gaze-based authentication system** that enhances security by detecting **eye movements and blinks** to prevent unauthorized access from **shoulder surfers**. This project eliminates the need for traditional passwords and PINs by using **real-time eye tracking** for authentication.

## 🚀 Features

- 👁 **Gaze-Based Authentication** – Users authenticate using their eye movements and blinks instead of typing passwords.
- 🎯 **Real-Time Eye Tracking** – Detects and processes gaze direction and blinks using **OpenCV & Dlib**.
- 🔐 **Prevention of Shoulder Surfing Attacks** – Reduces the risk of password theft in public spaces.
- 📊 **High Accuracy** – Achieves **95% accuracy** in gaze tracking and **98% effectiveness** in preventing unauthorized access.
- 🖥 **Scalability** – Potential applications in **drowsiness detection, AR/VR, and secure logins**.
